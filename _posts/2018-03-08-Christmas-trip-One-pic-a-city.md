Spring hasn't come yet but daytime has gone back to normal. Thankfully, I feel **life** again. I found myself gained a bit more weight after xx went back to ChinaðŸ˜¢ Sometimes it's really a torture to eat with a guy who will never get fat! I decided to do something I've wanted for so long before people getting notice about my weight gain and losing more of my memory. So I started from stopping eating chips and candies (need to get rid of sweet chocolates as well) but more vegetables and grains, training 3-4 times a week (achived for two weeksðŸ’ª) and going to sleep earlier (still trying but not after 3 anymore).

My staying up late, from my point of view, is because of my laziness. Not willing to bruth my teeth, not willing to get my butt out of the chair. I overestimate myself all the time. Thingking about editting our own "The Amazing Race", I recorded competitions and interviews for several seasons of city run project but hasn't started. I wanted to do vlog of my trip but hundreds of fregments of videos frightened me out... **Too ambitious** girl, get moving pls, like your training.

So, here I am, doing my first part of **travel story** during Christmas break. 1 person, 13 days, 4 countries <br />

2017.12.30 - Copenhagen - Finally back to northern Europe! Language, buildings, smell like home. Homeland of Anderson, LEGO and Danish chairs <br />

I kinda enjoy travel alone after all these, every day is an exploration. Finding a nice hostel totally lights up the day, might even more expect than hotel! <br />

So next I'll talk about all the amazing hostels I found in Europe and how we squeezed Italy & Czech into 6 days. I'll also try to post something about my study here. I really am and spend a lot of time studying not just travelling, no jokeðŸ˜‚ Get yourself working girl, treat this place more seriously!
