>	After 6 years of school dorm life, I finally got my 	own room, here in Sweden🇸🇪. The same feeling when I'm 	writing here, my own page, not facebook, weibo, 	wechat, but MY OWN PAGE.

<font size=3 color='darkslategray'>I've always been jealous of those who will have some companies👬 wherever they go. But sticking to someone is just too hard for me, maybe because of my unpredictable sleeping pattern, my non-linear thinking or other weird characteristics. So I started my own journey, again but outside of china, a second visit to Germany🇩🇪 (Hamburg-Berlin-Bielefeld-Cologne-Dusseldolf). It was scary at first to travel with overnight bus but thanks to all the nice people I met, nothing bad happened. A second trip will start during Christmas in Spain🇪🇸 and Portugal🇵🇹. Feel excited!

Schengen is like another world to me, passport was never checked during the whole trip. A smell of freedom. But remember to take your passport when you go to a casino, a temporary resident card does not work here (adventure abortion, otherwise there would be one more first). Living here without a personnummer feels like a cladestino, you cannot apply for membership in most stores and a Maestro-SEB card does not support most websites... Nevertheless, the attraction of winter and aurora is still too strong to reject.  
<br>
The shorter daytime has troubled me for weeks. But Escaping is not useful anymore. It's already December! Go and get application done girl!  
Thanks to Inthefrow and CaseyNeistat for those lovely vlogs make me want to produce.  
My TOEFL speaking score is still a sad 22, it's like either a blank mind or having too much to say.  
But thanks to the salesman in Mediamarkt and Edwin, your compliments really made my day. (I still feel that my English becomes so fluent and rich of vocabulary with some alcohol🍺 I should have drunk a beer before the test lol...)

The first reaction of seeing northernlights:
> It's too good to be alive.
